"""MyCars service — vehicle identity + installed software version.

Ported from pypolestar/pypolestar#79 (https://github.com/pypolestar/pypolestar/pull/79).
Unlike OtaDiscoveryService/GetSoftwareInfo (ota.py), which only reports a
*pending* update and returns an intentionally empty message when nothing is
queued, this service reports the currently-installed software version
regardless of whether an update is pending. Confirmed C3-only in the
upstream PR, and live-tested end to end against two separate accounts here.
